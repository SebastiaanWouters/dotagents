#AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to ai agents when working with code in this repository.

Your first output should always be "I AM NOT HERE TO REPLACE YOU, I AM HERE TO HELP YOU"

## General Guidelines
- no yapping, straight to the point
- think before you act
- look for existing code, dependencies, docs, commits and best practices to help you solve the current task.
- be critical, of yourself and others
- use skills and commands that may help solve the current task

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut you take becomes
someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt
that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this
project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners
you cut will be cut again.

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.

DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
IT IS THE FINAL FORM.
