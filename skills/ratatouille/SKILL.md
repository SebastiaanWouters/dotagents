# Ratatouille

Implement **one task** from `prd.json` per iteration using tracer-bullet methodology and a compounding engineering mindset. Maintain `progress.txt` across iterations.

## Trigger Formats

- `ratatouille: <short task hint>`
- `ratatouille: <file path>` (e.g., `ratatouille: prd.json`)

## Required Files

- `prd.json` (root)
- `progress.txt` (root)

## Workflow

### 0) Bootstrap (Always First)

1. Read `progress.txt` (if missing, create it).
2. Read `prd.json`. If missing, stop and ask user to run mise-en-place.
3. If this is the **first iteration**, ask what to do after each iteration and store in `progress.txt`.

Post-iteration action options:
- `qa` (run tests/checks)
- `simplify` (refactor for clarity)
- `deslop` (remove duplication, tighten docs)
- `review` (code-review + fix)
- `commit` (atomic commit)
- `none`

### 1) Pick the Next Task

- If the user provided a task hint, match it to a `tasks[].id` or `tasks[].title`.
- Otherwise, pick the first `status: "todo"` task.
- If multiple tasks are equally valid, ask the user to choose.

### 2) Tracer-Bullet Implementation

For the chosen task:
1. Identify layers involved (UI, API, DB, config, tests).
2. Build the **thinnest end-to-end slice** that works.
3. Validate it (minimal integration test or manual check).
4. Expand only after the tracer bullet is working.

### 3) Compound Engineering Mindset

Apply compounding leverage:
- Prefer reusable abstractions only after the tracer works.
- Automate or document any non-obvious learnings.
- Make improvements that reduce future work (tests, scripts, patterns).

### 4) Update `progress.txt`

Append a new section:

```
Iteration: <N>
Task: <id + title>
Status: done|partial|blocked
Decisions:
- ...
Learnings:
- ...
Next:
- ...
Post-Iteration Actions:
- qa|simplify|deslop|review|commit|none
```

### 5) Update `prd.json`

- Set task `status` to `done` or `partial`.
- Add notes if blocked.
- Keep `updated` date fresh.

### 6) Run Post-Iteration Actions

Use the actions recorded in `progress.txt`:
- `qa`: run relevant tests/checks
- `simplify`: simplify or refactor touched code
- `deslop`: remove duplication, tighten docs
- `review`: run a code review and fix issues
- `commit`: create an atomic commit

### 7) Recursive Handoff

If tasks remain, re-trigger ratatouille:

- If the harness supports `/handoff` or `/new`, re-issue the same prompt with updated context.
- Otherwise, ask the user to re-run the same `ratatouille:` command.

## Notes

- Always start by reading `progress.txt`.
- Implement **one task per iteration**.
- Keep changes scoped and verified.
