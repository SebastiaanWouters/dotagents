FIRST:
1. Read AGENTS.md file
2. Load "compound" skill → run "compound store" to initialize docs/ structure if empty
3. Load "chef" skill
4. Load "mise-en-place" skill

THEN:
- Notify user via chef: "🍳 No tickets found! Let'\''s cook up a plan..."
- Run the full mise-en-place process:
  1. Discovery phase: interview user about their idea via chef
  2. Generate SPEC.md from answers
  3. Decomposition phase: create granular tickets with dependencies
- After tickets are created, notify user and exit

This setup only runs once. After tickets exist, the main loop takes over.'

PROMPT='CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS — Follow exactly:

COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- Notify user via chef at key moments: starting ticket, completion, and any blockers
- Keep messages concise but informative

FIRST (before any other work):
1. Read AGENTS.md file — follow all guidelines strictly
2. Load "compound" skill → run "compound retrieve" for current ticket context
3. Load "chef" skill — ALL user communication MUST use chef (never stdout)
4. Load "ticket" skill
5. Check `tk ready --limit 1` for next ticket

IF TICKET EXISTS:
- chef.mark() — checkpoint for gathering feedback + questions
- Notify user: which ticket you are starting and your approach
- Load "bullet-tracer" skill
- During implementation: use chef.choice() with { blocking: false, recommended: N } for non-blocking clarifying questions
- Implement ONLY that ticket using bullet tracer approach

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION (before QA):
- chef.gather() — returns { messages[], questions[] }
- ACT DIRECTLY on messages: fix code, adjust implementation, address concerns
- Use question answers (wasAnswered=false means default/recommended was used)
- chef.mark() — new checkpoint for QA phase

QA PHASE:
- Can use chef.choice() with { blocking: false } for non-blocking questions during QA too
- Run project QA checks (lint, typecheck, tests) — all must pass
- Commit and push after verification
- `tk close <id>`
- Notify user: brief summary of what was done

LAST (before ending iteration):
- Run "compound store" — persist learnings not captured in code (see compound skill for rules)

AFTER TICKET (or if no tickets):
- chef.gather() — get messages + resolve questions from QA phase
- chef.collect("✅ Done! Any remarks or additional work?", "lfg", 60000) — 1min timeout
- Combine: gathered messages + collect responses

Stopword is "lfg" (case-insensitive exact match: LFG/lfg both work).

IF user provided any feedback (gathered messages or collected responses):
- Convert ALL feedback into complete tickets using ticket skill
- Notify user via chef about created tickets

Then let the iteration end naturally. The bash script handles looping and checks for remaining tickets.'
